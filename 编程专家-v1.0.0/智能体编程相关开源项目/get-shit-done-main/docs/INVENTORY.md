# GSD Shipped Surface Inventory

> Authoritative roster of every shipped GSD surface: commands, agents, workflows, references, CLI modules, and hooks. Where the broad docs (AGENTS.md, COMMANDS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CLI-TOOLS.md) diverge from the filesystem, treat this file and the repository tree itself as the source of truth.

## How To Use This File

- Counts here are derived from the filesystem at the v1.36.0 pin and may drift between releases. For live counts, run `ls commands/gsd/*.md | wc -l`, `ls agents/gsd-*.md | wc -l`, etc. against the checkout.
- This file enumerates every shipped surface across all six families (agents, commands, workflows, references, CLI modules, hooks). Broad docs may render narrative or curated subsets; when they disagree with the filesystem, this file and the directory listings are authoritative.
- New surfaces added after v1.36.0 should land here first, then propagate to the broad docs. The drift-control tests in `tests/inventory-counts.test.cjs`, `tests/commands-doc-parity.test.cjs`, `tests/agents-doc-parity.test.cjs`, `tests/cli-modules-doc-parity.test.cjs`, `tests/hooks-doc-parity.test.cjs`, `tests/architecture-counts.test.cjs`, and `tests/command-count-sync.test.cjs` anchor the counts and roster contents against the filesystem.

**Coverage note.** `docs/AGENTS.md` gives full role cards for 21 primary agents plus concise stubs for the 12 advanced agents. The Agent Tool Permissions Summary in that file covers only the primary 21 agents; the advanced agents' tool lists are captured in their per-agent frontmatter in `agents/gsd-*.md`.

## Commands (86 shipped)

Full roster at `commands/gsd/*.md`. The groupings below mirror `docs/COMMANDS.md` section order; each row carries the command name, a one-line role derived from the command's frontmatter `description:`, and a link to the source file. `tests/command-count-sync.test.cjs` locks the count against the filesystem.

## Maintenance

- When a new command, agent, workflow, reference, CLI module, or hook ships, update the corresponding section here before the release is cut.
- The drift-guard tests under `tests/` (see "How To Use This File" above) assert that every shipped file is enumerated in this inventory. A new file without a matching row here will fail CI.
- When the filesystem diverges from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` counts or from curated-subset docs (e.g. `docs/AGENTS.md`'s primary roster), this file is the source of truth.
